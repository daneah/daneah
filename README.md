I'm a software engineer and web developer interested in education, biotechnology, and open source.

## Publishing Python Packages

The life of a maintainer can be hard. Beyond writing working code, you have to triage issues, review pull requests, and create releases regularly. Don't let the logistics of package management get in your way. I'm currently writing [_Publishing Python Packages_](https://pypackages.com), a book about creating and streamlining a repeatable process for authoring and maintaining Python packages. Whether you're looking to create your first published Python package or trying to reduce the maintenance burden of the packages you already work on, _Publishing Python Packages_ has something for you.

## Practices of the Python Pro

If you're new to the software development industry, consider checking out my book, [_Practices of the Python Pro_](https://thepythonpro.com). It provides broad introductory coverage of software design, maintenance, and testing. You might also want to check out [daneah/practices-of-the-python-pro](https://github.com/daneah/practices-of-the-python-pro) for the accompanying code samples.

## Exploring Software Extensibility

With two chapters from _Practices of the Python Pro_ and one chapter each from _Object Design Style Guide_ and _The Design of Web APIs_, [_Exploring Software Extensibility_](https://www.manning.com/books/exploring-software-extensibility) is a great entrypoint into the ideas that make software live a long life. Software is rarely complete, so building it to last by being open to future requirements and change is a must.
