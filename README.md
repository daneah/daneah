## Practices of the Python Pro

If you're new to the software development industry, consider checking out my book, [_Practices of the Python Pro_](https://thepythonpro.com). It provides broad introductory coverage of software design, maintenance, and testing. You might also want to check out [daneah/practices-of-the-python-pro](https://github.com/daneah/practices-of-the-python-pro) for the accompanying code samples.
