I'm a software engineer and web developer interested in education, biotechnology, and open source.

## Practices of the Python Pro

If you're new to the software development industry, consider checking out my book, [_Practices of the Python Pro_](https://thepythonpro.com). It provides broad introductory coverage of software design, maintenance, and testing. You might also want to check out [daneah/practices-of-the-python-pro](https://github.com/daneah/practices-of-the-python-pro) for the accompanying code samples.

## Exploring Software Extensibility

With two chapters from _Practices of the Python Pro_ and one chapter each from _Object Design Style Guide_ and _The Design of Web APIs_, [_Exploring Software Extensibility_](https://www.manning.com/books/exploring-software-extensibility) is a great entrypoint into the ideas that make software live a long life. Software is rarely complete, so building it to last by being open to future requirements and change is a must.
